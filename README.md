# Welcome to My Mastermind
***

## Task
the problem is to write a program called mastermind; it will be an implementation of the famous game.and the challenge is where to specifies the number of attempts; by default, the playerhas 10 attempts.
## Description
I uses code for trial-and-error to crack the secret code. if all color in a row are the same color but none are in the correct position, you can eliminate that color from those slot
The key is using logic to narrow down the possibilities with each guess, while also considering the specific rules and constraints of the particular Mastermind game being played.
## Installation
No need of installation on the program.
## Usage
Mastermind is a code-breaking game where the player has to guess a secret code composed of 4 distinct pieces
from a set of 9 possible colors (represented by the digits 0-8). The player has 10 attempts to guess the code.
After each guess, the game provides feedback on the number of well-placed and misplaced pieces.

we use this command "make" to run the binary file

./my_mastermind -c "0123"
we used the above command to specifies the secret code. If no code is specified, a random code will be generated.
